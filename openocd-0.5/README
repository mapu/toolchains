to build openocd, do as follows:
1. run "./configure" shell script.
2. run "make" to build binary object. 
   Afte make, an executable named "openocd" is generated, run openocd to start openocd
   
Optional make targets:
(1) "make clean" to delete generated object files, not including makefiles 
	residing in each subdirectories.
(2) "make distclean" delete all generated object files and all make files, 
	which means you need to rerun configure script to generate makefiles
	
(3) "make install" will install mocd at /usr/local. 
	This operation is not recommended at present.
