///////arm/////////////////

The name of arm main is FFT_arm,the fuction is DMA from cDDR to 4 APEs'DMs,and call SPU program.

soure signal is data_in and factor is factor_in ,they are stored in data.h;

According to the algorithm,1M point soure signals into the matrix of 1024 * 1024,

1.fft arithmetic by column is 1024 point in 1024 operations;

2.multiplied by the corresponding factor;

3.fft arithmetic by row is 1024 point in 1024 operations.

4.the result is column order into 1M point signals .

/////////spu/////////////

spu contain two folders,one is SPULoad and another one is SPULoad_2.

1.SPULoad is that fft arithmetic by column ,and then,multiplied by the corresponding factor;

2.SPULoad_2 is that fft arithmetic by row.

////////mpu////////////

no mpu at present.
