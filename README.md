# Welcome to the MaPU toolchain!
This repostior contains the complete toolchain used for the first MaPU chip, including assembler, linker, compiler, simulator, debugger and necessary linux port and bootloader.

The toolchain is up to date, but we are adding the examples and translating the documentations.
## Rerequest

The toolchain is fully tested in CentOS 7.0.1, we can't guarantee other distributions yet.

## Quick start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mapu/toolchains.git
cd toolchains
./INSTALL.sh <dest_dir> # The dest_dir should be an absolute path.
```
